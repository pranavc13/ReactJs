# 🚀 ReactJS Learning Journey

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to my **ReactJS Learning Repository**! 🎉 Over the past few weeks, I have been working on **12 projects**, ranging from beginner-friendly concepts to advanced implementations. Each project has helped me dive deeper into **ReactJS**, and I am excited to share my journey with you! 🚀

## 🏆 What I Learned

Throughout this journey, I explored various **React concepts and best practices**, including:
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** for styling React applications.
- 🔥 **Vite** as a fast and efficient build tool for React.
- 🔄 **State Management** using React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
- 📌 **React Router** for seamless navigation.
- ⚡ **Context API & Redux Toolkit** for advanced state management.
- 🎭 **AI-based React Integrations**.
- 🛠 **Building Utility-Based Applications** such as password generators, background changers, and currency converters.
